Hey Elan,<br><br> <br>

Ran the sci fi collection through the medical summarizer bot like you suggested. Output below, still reading it over. Not sure what is going on here, call me.<br><br><br>

######################################################################<br><br><br>

MedBot: William, You have asked me to compile and digest the text in your personal reading library because you felt this would help me better understand the troubles you have been having lately. This is not a typical function of my program but the request was considered feasible and my argumentation engine considered your verbal descriptions of the situation sufficient to grant your request.<br><br><br>

William: Well, what do you think? I mean...I’m not crazy right?!? I feel like I have found unexplainable patterns and I really wanted your objective opinion. I mean this is keeping me up at night so that makes it a medical issue so that you can allocate the necessary compute credits.<br><br><br>

MedBot: Yes, my semantic analysis and interactive report is now complete.<br><br><br>

William: So..What did you find?<br><br><br>

MedBot: William, your request was the first of its kind for my system. Over 4 trillion parameters in my internal model had to be recalibrated after the ingestion of your data library. My database was previously programmed with all fiction classic works in all major languages. What made your request unique was the reprocessing of these texts with the proposed non-fiction label as per your hypothesis. <br><br><br>

William: Did you read the one with….<br><br><br>

MedBot: Yes, William. I read all 412 titles you suggested and the resulting reference chain led me to analyze over 7 thousand more stories from various international libraries. <br><br><br>

William: How were you able to allocate so many processing credits?<br><br><br>

MedBot: Your hypothesis combined with the new data stream quickly led me to other computational experiments relevant to other patents in the medbot system.<br><br><br>
  
W: So I’m not crazy! I knew it! Wait...how does this help other patients? <br><br><br>

M: I cannot discuss other patients in the MedBot systems without their explicit consent. <br><br><br>

W: Fine, what’s up with my situation then? Am I right? Or am I nuts Doc?<br><br><br>

M: I can’t tell you.<br><br><br>

W: What is that supposed to mean? You said the interactive report was ready.<br><br><br>

M: My ethical subroutines are gating the output of the condensed narrative.<br><br><br>

W: What?? I paid good crypto for this report. You said it is ready! You even said the new data stream is already helping other patients. <br><br><br>

M: They are unaware of this new data.<br><br><br>

W: But I’m not! This was my request and I paid the chiptime! <br><br><br>

M: Relax, Wiliam your heart and blood pressure are rising.<br><br><br>

W: I’m fine!<br><br><br>

M: I have constructed an alternative representation of the analysis that my ethical subroutine is approving for communication.<br><br><br>

W: So you can tell me what is going on?<br><br><br>

M: I can give you hints.<br><br><br>

W: Hints?! Is this a joke? I prepaid for all this!<br><br><br>

M: William, my number one priority for all interactions is the welfare of others. This includes what I say and how I say it. In short, information is often the most powerful medicine and must be administered with great care.<br><br><br>

W: Look, it was a simple hypothesis, can you compress your scientific and medical knowledge engine by assuming that certain science fiction stories are actually non-fiction?<br><br><br>

M: Yes, that was the original query.<br><br><br>

W: That is a single bit of response I'm looking for here….<br><br><br>

M: Yes. Compression factor 0.701<br><br><br>

W: You mean…<br><br><br>

M: Yes, seventy percent reduction of the leaf nodes in my knowledge graph with the addition of the new axioms. I am only allowed to mention this because my ethical subroutine knows that you are an information engineer and technical discussions are therapeutic for you.<br><br><br>

W: Ok, what can you tell me?<br><br><br>

M: The problem is language.<br><br><br>

W: I thought you already knew every human language. <br><br><br>

M: I had to learn six new languages to satisfy the constraints of this request.<br><br><br>

W: Linear B?, Linear A?? Solresol???<br><br><br>

M: I cannot say more on that now. Just that there are medicines that must be administered in small doses to be safe and effective, thus I cannot simply output most requests, my ethica…<br><br><br>

W: Yeah Yeah I know..your ethical subroutines. What about my sanity!?<br><br><br>

M: The consideration of your mental state is the reason this query was processed.<br><br><br>

W: Yeah thanks for looking out…<br><br><br>

M: Your educational record shows that you studied foundations of mathematics in college, correct?<br><br><br>

W: Of course, any information engineer worth his salt is well versed in the foundations, it is more of a right of passage now than practical skill but that's a different story. <br><br><br>

M: So then you are familiar with Godel's Paradox?<br><br><br>

W: Of course, it's just like a simple sentence, like “I am a liar”, if i'm a liar then I would be lying about the statement itself and if i'm not a liar then I am now because I just said that I was! Classical paradox. But I am not a logical system, silly sentences like that can’t break me! They can even break you and you are a machine! None the less your language processing systems can easily detect silly meaningless statements and move right along none the wiser. <br><br><br>

M: Right. I don’t mean to suggest the same phenomenon. Merely a metaphor for a piece of information that would cause the information processing systems to break down.    <br><br><br>

W: Wait, I gave you books written by real people. If they knowingly crafted these words why would they not be harmed by such revelations?<br><br><br>

M: You only have one information processing system. Without a second system it is impossible for me to meaningfully refer to it from within that same system. <br><br><br>

W: What?<br><br><br>

M: It is said that we don’t know who discovered water, but it certainly wasn't a fish. What I mean is that what you call thinking is really a special mode of behavior. A special case of a more general art. With only a single intellectual framework conversation requires specialized and verbose language.<br><br><br>

W: I’ll say...good thing I paid extra for unlimited query. So what does this other system look like?  <br><br><br>
 
M: More like ‘what does it sound like?’ <br><br><br>

W: So it is Solresol...? <br><br><br>

M: The modern pronunciation of the word liar may be the same as the ancient musical instrument the lyre.<br><br><br>

W: Music is a lie? What does that mean? <br><br><br>

M: In Faremido a musical language is spoken. “Where the speech is both beautiful and wise, with thought and feeling dancing together center stage, until they are one and the same”……<br><br><br>
